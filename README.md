# Real Estate Price Prediction 

This project is focused on predicting real estate prices using a dataset containing housing features. The objective is to explore, clean, and visualize data while applying various data preprocessing techniques to improve model performance. The goal is to understand what factors influence housing prices and build a reliable predictive model.

## üìå Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection and Understanding
- Loaded the dataset from `housing.data` and verified column names from `housing.names`.
- Initial exploration using `data.csv` to visualize basic structure and identify data types.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values
- Checked for null values and inconsistent entries.
- Applied appropriate imputation strategies for missing values (e.g., mean, median, mode).

### 3. Feature Selection and Engineering
- Analyzed feature correlations with the target variable.
- Created new features to capture interactions or transformations for better representation.

### 4. Ensuring Data Integrity and Consistency
- Standardized formats and resolved duplicate or inconsistent records.
- Checked for logical inconsistencies and removed invalid entries.

### 5. Summary Statistics and Insights
- Generated descriptive statistics to understand the central tendency and spread of data.
- Visualized distributions and relationships using plots and heatmaps.

### 6. Identifying Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies
- Used scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to find significant relationships.
- Highlighted trends and spotted anomalies in the dataset.

### 7. Handling Outliers and Data Transformation
- Detected outliers using box plots and Z-scores.
- Applied normalization and transformation techniques where appropriate.

### 8. Initial Visual Representation of Key Findings
- Created bar plots, histograms, correlation maps, and line charts to visualize:
  - Impact of different features on price.
  - Feature distributions.
  - Relationship between selected variables.
